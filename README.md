BE 490 Independent Study - Quantifying Scoliosis Severity using Differential Geometry

files include a graphical user interface for segmenting vertebrae from axial CT scan and a script for analyzing segmented vertebrae to calculate twist and writhe. 

getTwist and getWrithe use discrete approximations of integrals/derivatives. levittWrithe uses a different method to calculate Writhe that has previously been used on protein and DNA folding.
